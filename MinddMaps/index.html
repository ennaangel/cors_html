<h1>Mindmaps</h1>
Something I've had on my mind for a while is the idea of doing some research into Mindmaps. The things I want to do related to this subject are
<ul>
  <li> Do Mindmaps aid in the learning process? </li>
  <li> If so, how does it compare to usual learning methods, i.e, note taking or writing a summary? </li>
  <li> Researching what quantities define a network or can be defined when considering a network. </li>
  <li> Collect mindmaps. </li>
  <li> Quantify mindmaps and see if this is related to certain demographics. </li>
  <li> Write an articel about my findings. </li>
</ul>

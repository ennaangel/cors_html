        Hello dear viewer. Since elementary school I have been captivated by the idea of the <i>"Uomo universale"</i>, the universal man. A person that has a knowledge in a large number of fields and also poses a wide range of skills. Therefor I wanted to understand how to build a webpage and so this page was born.
		For me personally this means 
		<ul>
		<li>Learning, practicing, and teaching martial arts. </li>
		<li>Reading books and scientific papers on different subjects like genetics, health, neuroscience, physics, artifical intelligence, networks and others. </li>
		<li>Improving my drawing skills; mainly understanding the human figure and it's anatomy. </li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		<div id="site">
		On this website I try to combine different interests and skills of mine. So it covers subject as physics, martial arts, and art. I'm building this website from the basics to improve my knowledge on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Therefor it also contains some javascript experiments.
